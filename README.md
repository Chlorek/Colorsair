User-space driver for Unix systems for Corsair Ligtning Node, RGB fans. Personally I have two fans, 
so it is the only tested configuration now (however I did put effort to make it work with any number of fans).


WARNING: This project is prototype as it is now, but I am going to make it fully featured driver/controller.
It has no interface whatsoever or way to control it outside of programming API yet.
